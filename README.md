# **8-Week SQL Challenge**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to my repository for the **8-Week SQL Challenge**, a series of case studies designed by [Danny Ma](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) to enhance SQL skills through real-world business scenarios. Each case study focuses on solving practical data problems using SQL techniques, ranging from basic queries to advanced analytical functions.

This repository showcases my solutions for the first two case studies, where I have explored real-world datasets and answered complex business questions. Through these case studies, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of SQL and demonstrate my ability to derive actionable insights from data.
